11:24 <crakun>pelase download
11:24 <crakun>ping me if you want Skype
11:25 <i3ppwn_>obj we know it's safe
11:27 <crakun>ok, will start adding people on Skype
11:28 <i3ppwn_>give me credit for panic log
11:28 <i3ppwn_>lol
11:28 <pr0crast1nate>yayy
11:28 <i3ppwn_>guys we should use shellcode to get asm code running
11:29 <crakun>anybody not on skype
11:29 <HENLEYbls>me
11:29 <HENLEYbls>Im new lol
11:29 <crakun>did u skype me
11:30 <HENLEYbls>ive added you
11:30 <i3ppwn_>also crakun what about phys_to_virt and virt_to_phys
11:30 <HENLEYbls>assuming your crakun ...
11:30 <AdiSai1>hello guys
11:30 <i3ppwn_>hi
11:31 <tihmstar>not many people on skype
11:31 <AdiSai1>I'm not
11:31 <tihmstar>class starting now
11:31 * tihmstar logs now
11:32 <tihmstar>slide 9
11:32 <AdiSai1>where are the slides?
11:32 <HENLEYbls>http://www.hotwan.com/class/MHVI-Day10c.pdf
11:32 <tihmstar>we need to bypass KASLR
11:33 <tihmstar>posixspawn was a good methon, but it's patched now
11:33 <i3ppwn_>we can corrupt it using null ponter derferences
11:33 <tihmstar>we might do that with kernelpanics
11:34 <i3ppwn_>no
11:34 <tihmstar>we have a.mov / 1.mov (same file)
11:34 <i3ppwn_>wat ? kernelpanics has nothing to do with that
11:34 <tihmstar>we're moving it to m0bdev
11:34 <saelo>http://m0bdev.com/class/1.mov
11:34 <tihmstar>you can access the file at m0bdev.com/class/q.mov
11:34 <i3ppwn_>we can patch NX then we can us launchd
11:35 <pr0crast1nate>tihmstar you have a lot of static with your mic btw
11:35 <tihmstar>m0bdev.com/class/1.mov
11:35 <tihmstar> // its muted
11:35 <AdiSai1>crakun you here?
11:35 <crakun>yes
11:35 <pr0crast1nate>tihmstar I know I was just letting you know
11:35 <tihmstar>if you connect a lot of data points you can derive an algorithm
11:35 <tihmstar>/ thx
11:35 <crakun>read slide deck
11:36 <tihmstar>best way (slide 13)
11:36 <AdiSai1>crakun Pm'ed
11:36 <tihmstar>link state analysis analogy
11:37 <tihmstar>so how do we translate this to kernelpanic log?
11:39 <tihmstar>we need to start the same boot process and search for an algorithm
11:39 <AdiSai1>crakun PM back?
11:39 <tihmstar>if we have same device model ios and navigate directly to website
11:39 <tihmstar>we can see if there is any consistancy in the panic logs
11:39 <tihmstar>this is an experiment
11:39 <tihmstar>proof of concept
11:40 <tihmstar>this is a very simple class exercise
11:40 <tihmstar>slide 15
11:40 <tihmstar>^homework
11:40 <tihmstar>please do not use the hotwan link, but this m0bdev.com/class/1.mov
11:40 <pr0crast1nate>https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn2063/_index.html Understanding and debugging kernel panics
11:41 <tihmstar>newcomers please do the homework on slide 15
11:41 <tihmstar>isn't that hard
11:41 <tihmstar>questions?
11:42 <tihmstar>next week we'll be moving to Javascript
11:42 <tihmstar>fuzzing
11:42 <saelo>nice reference, thanks pr0crast1nate
11:42 <tihmstar>(crak,un is adding more people)
11:46 <tihmstar>we think we could maybe split the class
11:46 <tihmstar>because we need multiple exploits
11:46 <AdiSai1>ya
11:46 <AdiSai1>I need a team to help with the GUI
11:46 <tihmstar>but we might do a jailbreak with 1.mov
11:46 <tihmstar>a multi stage attack with 1.mov
11:47 <tihmstar>but that would propably take a lot of time
11:47 <tihmstar>so we should break it up in different type of attacks
11:47 <tihmstar>so for userland we should attack safari, JavaScript
11:48 <iMegacier>not php?
11:48 <crakun>please mute microphone
11:49 <tihmstar> // can't understand, sorry someone didn't mute
11:49 <saelo>iMegacier php? We are attacking the client, not the server
11:50 <AdiSai1>what?
11:50 <tihmstar>we've seen an html5 fuzzer
11:50 <tihmstar>done by mozilla (wtf?)
11:50 <tihmstar>newcomers, we need imformation researchers
11:51 <tihmstar>webkit, javascript fuzzers etc
11:51 <saelo>why not? Chromium has their own fuzzers as well
11:51 <tihmstar>send links and doc to crakun
11:51 <saelo>http://blog.chromium.org/2012/04/fuzzing-for-security.html
11:51 <tihmstar>we need that for slide decks
11:52 <tihmstar>audio on podcast.m0bdev.com
11:52 <tihmstar>simply grab it with any podcast app
11:53 <tihmstar>core is fucusing on kernel
11:53 <tihmstar>community is focusing on userland
11:53 <tihmstar>open floor
11:53 <tihmstar>any questions?
11:54 <isa56k>Any one tried kernel IOctl fuzzing?
11:54 <AdiSai1>nope
11:54 <_3x7R00Tripper>I will make a post about all what we do on my website. I will look for slides and more.
11:54 <_3x7R00Tripper>You find all on http://3x7R00Tripper.com but the last post have slides only. http://3x7r00tripper.com/jsandhtml5-m0bdev.php
11:54 <AdiSai1>Podcast!
11:54 <AdiSai1>will it work on the iOS Podcasts app?
11:54 <tihmstar>we will have an overview page with all information on m0bdevserver later
11:54 <tihmstar>AdiSai1 yes
11:54 <AdiSai1>How do I subscribe for it?
11:55 <tihmstar>AdiSai1 open podcast app and navigate to the link podcast.m0bdev.com
11:55 <AdiSai1>ok
11:55 <AdiSai1>in safari?
11:55 <tihmstar>oh you can do that too
11:55 <tihmstar>just open podcast.m0bdev.com in safari, while having podcast app installed
11:56 <AdiSai1>ok
11:56 <AdiSai1>thanks!
