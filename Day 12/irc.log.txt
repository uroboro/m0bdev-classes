11:43 <crakun>for info
11:44 <tihmstar>apple's opensource has things missing
11:44 <tihmstar>there is an implementation by other trying to make javascript core for ios target
11:44 <tihmstar>this is different to mov
11:44 <tihmstar>now we have source code
11:45 <crakun>slide 14
11:45 <crakun>interesting project that people put together
11:45 <tihmstar>when we do find bus we can look back at source code
11:45 <tihmstar>we will make JS fuzzers
11:45 <iMegacier>Can anyone call me again :'(
11:45 <tihmstar>slide 15
11:45 <tihmstar>JavascriptCore Framework
11:45 <pr0crast1nate>http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/JavaScriptCore/JavaScriptCore-7537.65/
11:45 <iMegacier>Can anyone call me again ? please
11:45 <tihmstar>Nitro has JIT support
11:46 <pr0crast1nate>(apologies if that's in the slide deck, it hasn't downloaded for me yet)
11:46 <tihmstar>JIT has dynamic code signing
11:46 <tihmstar>Safari is the only process which is allowed to use dynamic code signing
11:46 <iMegacier>THx
11:46 <tihmstar> // lost crakun :(
11:46 <pr0crast1nate>tihmstar me too

11:48 <crakun>i think I lost people on Skype
11:48 <crakun>so let's continue on chat
11:48 <HENLEYbls>^^

11:48 <saelo>fuck Skype/Microsoft  :)
11:48 <tihmstar>^

11:52 <iMegacier>You don't skype on SKype?
11:52 <iMegacier>*speak?
11:52 <crakun>slide 19 both given you some samples to go thru
11:53 <tihmstar>slide 18/19 are examples
11:53 <tihmstar>slide 20 browser fuzzing
11:54 <crakun>slide 20 is browser
11:54 <crakun>fuzzing
11:54 <tihmstar>not only you can fuzz JS but also HTML5 tags css events etc
11:54 <pr0crast1nate>saelo HENLEYbls and pr0crast1nate have fuzzy goodness in store for everyone :)
11:54 <tihmstar>so we can combine those
11:55 <tihmstar>we have quite a few fuzzers (slide 21)
11:55 <tihmstar>we could use javascript scanners
11:56 <crakun>slide 21 is where we she focus
11:57 <tihmstar>html5
11:58 <tihmstar>slide 22 (page 21)
11:58 <crakun>please follow slide deck numbers
11:58 <crakun>they are slightly off set in numbering
11:58 <crakun>html5 is a beta
11:58 <tihmstar>html5 is in beta
11:58 <tihmstar>new pieces are still added
11:59 <tihmstar>there can be bugs in new stuff
11:59 <tihmstar>unlike mov
11:59 <tihmstar>where the format is old
11:59 <SLIDENUMBER>~22~
11:59 <tihmstar>you see the lides
11:59 <tihmstar>track and video
11:59 <tihmstar>when you use them that forwads you to the mediaserverdaemon
12:00 <tihmstar>so we can look in them and try to combine with our mov files
12:00 <iMegacier>crakun is speaking?
12:00 <crakun>yes
12:00 <tihmstar>(yep, there will be a voice recording)
12:00 <crakun>http://www.quackit.com
12:00 <crakun>for html5 tags
12:00 <crakun>so we can fuzz these
12:01 <tihmstar>think of them like xml elements we can fuzz
12:01 <crakun>video within a video tag,e tc
12:01 <tihmstar>homework
12:01 <SLIDENUMBER>fuzzyMacchiato will debuting soon
12:01 <crakun>modular
12:02 * HENLEYbls Bows
12:02 <tihmstar>^ a javascript fuzzer
12:02 <tihmstar>webserver based on ruby
12:02 <HENLEYbls>Yeah will do alot of this type of fuzzing for you
12:02 <tihmstar>construct dom
12:02 <tihmstar>generates test cases
12:02 <tihmstar>sends to device
12:02 <tihmstar>then pings device
12:03 <tihmstar>if device doesnt respond deice propably crashed
12:03 <tihmstar>general population use pretty soon
12:03 <tihmstar>just a few things to do
12:03 <tihmstar>ready in 1-2 weeks
12:04 <tihmstar>we still need your crash reports
12:04 <tihmstar>so please still send the crash reports
12:04 <HENLEYbls>fingers crossed ... tihmstar> ready in 1-2 weeks
12:05 <pr0crast1nate>We'll be targeting SVG bugs, UAF, Double Free bugs, Heap Spraying
12:05 <iMegacier>svg is a good idea
12:05 <pr0crast1nate>and anything else can be added later really easily
12:05 <crakun>slide 28 jsut to keep moving
12:06 <pr0crast1nate>saelo came up with the SVG idea ;)
12:06 <pr0crast1nate>(I lost skype connection btw)
12:06 <iMegacier>I've got a code in HTML 5 that makes EVERY browser freeze. Are you intereted in?
12:07 <crakun>keep in mind that video tag will direct you to mediaserverd
12:07 <tihmstar>iMegacier pm me
12:07 <crakun>our old vulnerable friend

12:11 <iMegacier>tihmstar  Don't have the source code on this computer, I'll boot the good one
12:12 <HENLEYbls>Stick to class people and sort that when we are done ....
12:12 <crakun>so KASLR
12:12 <HENLEYbls>crakun has come out of his way to do this
12:12 <crakun>I have go thru other people's studies
12:12 <crakun>research, etc
12:13 <pr0crast1nate>crakun your slide decks are awesome!

12:13 <pr0crast1nate>break all the things!
12:15 <crakun>slide 55, for people who have jailbroken /nonjailbroken phones can do
12:15 <crakun>who can't do anything except crash the phone
12:15 <crakun>for all the rest
12:15 <crakun>let's focus on javascirpt crashes
12:15 <pr0crast1nate>~SLIDE 55~
12:16 <crakun>locate other javascript fuzzer, browser fuzzers
12:16 <crakun>let me know
12:16 <crakun>ok
12:16 <crakun>thru with slide deck
12:16 <pr0crast1nate>get some sleep crakun :)
12:16 <saelo>at this point, if someone missed it last week https://github.com/saelo/iCrashalyzer
12:17 <saelo>you can use that to quickly anayze crash reports and stuff, works for userland + kernel
12:17 <crakun>so I will refine this slide deck next week
12:17 <crakun>we will do deeper next week
