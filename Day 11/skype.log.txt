[11:58:31] saelo7: vdso, vsyscall on linux
[11:58:33] crakun -: see mark dowd presentation at HITB last year
[11:58:46] (Orel Yamin™) iOS Hacker: Kernel panic
[11:59:18] saelo7: should be mapped read only in userland
[11:59:59] saelo7: sure
[12:00:56] louiskremer: Have you bought ida pro?
[12:00:59] saelo7: no
[12:01:09] saelo7: I'm using free version right now
[12:01:17] louiskremer: Ok I also.
[12:01:25] louiskremer: And Hopper
[12:03:31] John Thompson: Crakun I can help there
[12:03:34] imegacier: he's right
[12:03:41] imegacier: You have to pay
[12:04:03] compiling Entropy: xsplit
[12:04:03] iMegacier L0uis: Google chat
[12:04:12] iMegacier L0uis: very useful
[12:04:19] compiling Entropy: teamviewer
[12:04:21] Pr0 crast1nate: Google Hangouts?
[12:04:24] John Thompson: Crakun, I have a setup you can use that's commercial.
[12:04:30] (Orel Yamin™) iOS Hacker: On skype
[12:04:42] http: Mark Dowd's presentation at HITB 2012: bitly Pn4pe5
[12:04:43] isa56k .: Handbrake?
[12:04:43] sulphur27: eyes
[12:04:44] sulphur27: yes
[12:07:05] compiling Entropy: isa56k's bug works only on the 4S
[12:07:24] tihmstar-yt: how do you actually use gdb?
[12:07:41] tihmstar-yt: i tried to attach but safari freezed
[12:08:01] tihmstar-yt: yea
[12:08:13] tihmstar-yt: i mean when i attach it frozen
[12:08:30] tihmstar-yt: and when i deattach it works fine
[12:08:36] http: Anyone attached kernel debugger?
[12:11:24] tihmstar-yt: do we need a podbreakout for kernel debugging?
[12:12:16] (Orel Yamin™) iOS Hacker: Think yourself "do we need a podbreakout for kernel debugging?"
[12:12:28] tihmstar-yt: -__-
[12:12:36] louiskremer: I use it also but I don't use it in the last time
[12:13:13] iMegacier L0uis: Where are they?
[12:14:31 | Edited 12:14:42] tihmstar-yt: what can we actually do with the magic byte? i mean we know if it is xx it crashes but if it is xy id doesn ?
[12:14:56] iMegacier L0uis: Thanks
[12:15:18] Fede S: tihmstar, the question would be what is the magic byte?
[12:15:18] compiling Entropy: that's not even the directory
[12:15:24] iMegacier L0uis: We can find logs on iTunes after sync?
[12:15:29] iMegacier L0uis: I found some
[12:15:32] compiling Entropy: /private/var/mobile/Library/Logs/Panics/
[12:15:41] compiling Entropy: and the directory creates itself
[12:15:48] compiling Entropy: when you have your first panic
[12:16:01] compiling Entropy: they're also stored in another place
[12:16:28] tihmstar-yt: -sh-4.0# pwd
/var/mobile/Library/Logs
-sh-4.0# ls
AppleSupport              DuetLST.log         PLArchive
CrashReporter             FaceTime            Ubiquity
CurrentPowerlog.powerlog  MobileDelete        com.apple.itunesstored
DataMigration             MobileInstallation
[12:16:40] compiling Entropy: until you go to settings > general > about > diagnostics & usage, then they get moved in to /var/mobile/Library/Logs/
[12:16:52] compiling Entropy: CrashReporter
[12:16:53] louiskremer: This should all know :)
[12:16:56] http: Everyone should disable "submit crashes to Apple".
[12:17:07] louiskremer: Yea don't send to apple
[12:17:32] tihmstar-yt: yea it was you to pull that from ih8sn0w -_-
[12:17:35] compiling Entropy: /private/var/mobile/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/Panics
[12:17:35] louiskremer: If we send it to apple, we help apple :D
[12:18:17] compiling Entropy: crakun: I know how they do it
[12:18:18] saelo7: taskforpid(o) patch
[12:18:23] intram0rph: Ih8snow said he wrote a dumper
[12:18:24] saelo7: -_-
[12:18:44] intram0rph: Not sure who hell give it to..
[12:18:48] tihmstar-yt: i don't think he wants to publish that
[12:19:56] louiskremer: Can I downgrade from mavericks to mountain lion without buy mountain lion?
[12:20:44] tihmstar-yt: http://tihmstar.blogspot.de/2013/10/my-jailbreaktool-for-ios-7.html
[12:20:59] saelo7: you can get kernelcaches on iphone 4 by just taking them from ipsw and decrypting them
[12:21:20] compiling Entropy: ^
[12:21:38] D-link: How?
[12:21:48] Pr0 crast1nate: I'm recording the Skype call (hopefully) didn't test it beforehand
[12:22:04] compiling Entropy: getting kernelcaches for iPhone4 does not even require the device
[12:22:14] intram0rph: Mine says recording too
[12:22:50] http: Pr0: please share afterwards
[12:22:58] iMegacier L0uis: Good point
[12:23:04] Pr0 crast1nate: of course, will do!
[12:23:05] D-link: Good, keep it core
[12:24:47] saelo: or make m0bdev repo!
[12:24:58] isa56k .: What about using the OpenJailbreak.org site?
[12:25:09] (Orel Yamin™) iOS Hacker: Good idea
[12:25:22] isa56k .: for storing the source code of tools etc?
[12:25:33] (Orel Yamin™) iOS Hacker: Itiaprepo.com/m0bdev
[12:26:20] 3x7R00Tripper: yea good idea
[12:26:38] tihmstar-yt: what page?
[12:26:57] saelo: we should set up own repo on m0bdev server
[12:27:00] 3x7R00Tripper: Why don't buy a com domain
[12:27:05] saelo: also git repo for code
[12:27:16] (Orel Yamin™) iOS Hacker: You want this repo:Itiaprepo.com/m0bdev
[12:27:18] 3x7R00Tripper: yea
[12:27:26] 3x7R00Tripper: it's good
[12:27:27] tihmstar-yt: saelo: my repo is actually used for m0bdev and you can get all code on github
[12:27:46] (Orel Yamin™) iOS Hacker: If yes give me V or X
[12:27:51] saelo: I mean for code that we don't want to be public
[12:27:56] tihmstar-yt: oh
[12:28:09] iMegacier L0uis: How can people who don't code help jailbreak community?
[12:28:16] 3x7R00Tripper: Don't publish but we can buy a premium account(or no)
[12:28:28] D-link: Okay, so what resources are there for total n00bs?
[12:28:36] Pr0 crast1nate: ciao
[12:28:36] D-link: What books first?
[12:28:37] sulphur27: thanks
[12:28:38] saelo: thx

[12:31:16] 3x7R00Tripper: Read pdf documents first ;)
[12:32:04] 3x7R00Tripper: I learned the basics with this steps
