11:13 <crakun>hopefully everybody pinged me on skype
11:14 <crakun>10 secs more to ping me
11:14 <AdiSai1>hi SwissHttp
11:14 <crakun>got alot of folks
11:14 <crakun>here
11:14 <crakun>did u donwload slides?
11:14 <compilingEntropy>http://www.hotwan.com/class/MHVI-Day8d_Published.pdf
11:14 <iMegacier>http://www.hotwan.com/class/MHVI-Day8d_Published.pdf
11:15 <tihmstar>class agenda for new people
11:15 <tihmstar>a lot of people joining us
11:15 <tihmstar>first step for new people: submit a bug
11:16 <tihmstar>but we want to involve people who can't code too
11:16 <compilingEntropy>(tihmstar is transcribing some things crakun is saying)
11:16 <tihmstar>we need to figure out how to dump kernel etc
11:17 <tihmstar>so you have to ask people like winocm ih8sn0w and other
11:17 <tihmstar>but don't waste their time asking stupid questions
11:17 <tihmstar>we decided to switch to bug 2.mov
11:17 <tihmstar>by sulphur27
11:17 <tihmstar>kernelpanic a lot of devices (maybe all)
11:18 <tihmstar>somebody from class posted the file on the internet
11:18 <tihmstar>i0nic found it and said it was a jailbreak
11:18 <fr3b>kenel panic
11:19 <tihmstar>i0nic took creadit for the file making people belive it'd be a jailbreak
11:19 <tihmstar>saelo will talk to us later
11:19 <tihmstar>you will need to download his slides later
11:19 <saelo>I'll post link later :)
11:20 <tihmstar>just because geohot or winocm says the nullpointer is not exploitable don't give up
11:20 <tihmstar>still continue looking at it we could exploit it anyway
11:20 <tihmstar>(maybe by continueing fuzzing the file)
11:20 <tihmstar>or maybe there is more that one "magic byte" which could be exploitable
11:21 <SwissHttp>we're on slide 2
11:21 <tihmstar>next we will do some RE steps
11:21 <tihmstar>crakun is working on a very big slidedeck
11:22 <tihmstar>we develeoped tools / standard for fuzzing
11:22 <fr3b>what is fuzzing?
11:22 <tihmstar>we now need a process to look at bugs
11:22 <DarkMalloc>fr3b: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzz_testing
11:23 <fr3b>thanks
11:23 <tihmstar>bugs are not limited to mov files
11:23 <SwissHttp>now on slide 3
11:23 <tihmstar>slide 3
11:23 <tihmstar>thx SwissHttp
11:23 <tihmstar>we're building a core Members team
11:24 <SwissHttp>@tihmstar: I'll keep quiet to avoid double post here
11:24 <tihmstar>crakun: what about me??
11:24 <tihmstar>SwissHttp: pls post the slide number
11:24 <SwissHttp>ok
11:25 <tihmstar>again you don't have to code you can still help
11:25 <tihmstar>for exaple building websites, finding information
11:25 <tihmstar>logos etc
11:25 <tihmstar>we want our jailbreak team to be bigger
11:26 <fr3b>.mov files is just for testing and show to everyone the bugs we find
11:26 <SwissHttp>slide 4
11:26 <tihmstar>^ this is a summary
11:26 <tihmstar>what we are looking for
11:26 <SwissHttp>slide 6, old stuff
11:27 <tihmstar>crakun - craken lol
11:27 <SwissHttp>7
11:27 <tihmstar>bug submittal process
11:27 <tihmstar>don't give everybody your bugs
11:28 <tihmstar>only submit them to crakun!!!!
11:28 <tihmstar>we're getting more bugs every week
11:29 <tihmstar>we had 1.mov file in a zip and somebody from class unzipped and put it online and now even i0nic put that on twitter
11:29 <tihmstar>pls don't blow bugs if we don't have to!!
11:29 <tihmstar>remember apple can patch stuff
11:30 <tihmstar>core member group will work on a iphone 5s jb
11:30 <tihmstar>others will work on iphone 4 jb and maybe other
11:30 <tihmstar>we have to burn some bugs in the process but we do it selectevly
11:31 <SwissHttp>slide 7
11:31 <SwissHttp>slide 8, 9
11:31 <tihmstar>^ current bug
11:31 <SwissHttp>10,11 now, current bug
11:32 <tihmstar>ida pro will work for us
11:32 <tihmstar>for RE
11:32 <tihmstar>jb iphone, ssh - grab mediaserverd and look at it with ida pro
11:33 <SwissHttp>You can debug with HopperApp, cheap debugger.
11:33 <SwissHttp>sorry, disassembler
11:33 <tihmstar>dirkg got some tools for us
11:33 <SwissHttp>slide 16 now
11:33 <tihmstar>slides should give you some background info
11:34 <tihmstar>about mov files
11:34 <tihmstar>crakun read bug hunters diary and put some steps in the slides
11:34 <tihmstar>so you have all important info
11:34 <tihmstar>we'll also get slides from dirkg next week
11:35 <tihmstar>since i0nic tweeted our bug, let's see if apple patches it
11:35 <tihmstar>keep track on that
11:35 <tihmstar>apple may patch a bug slightly, so there might still be workarounds for it
11:36 <tihmstar>uroboro wrote a tool called hexdiff (available on repo.tihmstar.org)
11:37 <tihmstar>now sulphur27 talking
11:37 <tihmstar>he wrote a server to server the mov files
11:37 <DarkMalloc>Good work tihmstar.
11:37 <tihmstar>he fuzzes the files on the phone itself
11:38 <tihmstar>with the mov player
11:38 <tihmstar>sulphur27 you can put it on my repo
11:38 <tihmstar>he was looking at the files in the atom explorer
11:39 <tihmstar>he found the magic byte in the elementry stream description
11:39 <tihmstar>he could find what it does exaclty
11:39 <tihmstar>:(
11:39 <tihmstar>maybe some size of buffer to allocate
11:39 <uroboro>couldn't you mean?
11:39 <tihmstar>found some nice article
11:40 <tihmstar>https://blogs.oracle.com/ksplice/entry/much_ado_about_null_exploiting1
11:40 <tihmstar>*he found
11:40 <tihmstar>he'll still looking in the ffmpeg code
11:40 <tihmstar>open floor (i wont record that :P )
11:41 * tihmstar is lazy
11:41 <AdiSai1>ok
11:41 <sulphur27>tihmstar: sure i can
11:41 <tihmstar>sulphur27 talk to you after class ;)
11:42 <sulphur27>but it is a native app and i will need to make more "useable" so people can use it whithout cahnging source code ...
11:43 <saelo>wget yoursef a copy of this http://saelo.net/files/attacking_iOS_kernel-1.pdf
11:46 <crakun>if u are not on Skpe (m0bdev) let me know, ping me on Skype so I can add u
11:46 <uroboro>I'm not
11:47 <crakun>ping me on Skype now, so I can see u
11:47 <crakun>I don't know your ID
11:47 <crakun>ok
11:48 <crakun>u should be on
11:48 <crakun>now
11:48 <uroboro>I am, thanks
11:48 <crakun>we were talking about u and hexdiff, also the parser I think u mayb working on
11:49 <uroboro>oh
11:49 <crakun>hexdiff is mentioned in slde deck too
11:50 <SwissHttp>slide 7 on saelo's slides now
11:53 <SwissHttp>slide 10
12:00 <SwissHttp>back to slide 20 of crakun's slides
12:00 <AdiSai1>hi J_W97
12:00 <tihmstar>^ contains important stuff
12:00 <tihmstar>*slide 20
12:00 <tihmstar>-_-
12:01 <saelo>:D
12:02 <tihmstar>we can manupulate mov files so that's our entry in kernel/userland
12:04 <JBUni>you could always use justin.tv
12:05 <AdiSai1>or twitch.tv
12:05 <tihmstar>but what about the lagg?
12:05 <AdiSai1>not much lag
12:05 <tihmstar>i mean input lagg
12:06 <tihmstar>like when we talk on type but look at that on twitch
12:06 <tihmstar>i think there is a lagg
12:08 <AdiSai1>no
12:08 <AdiSai1>only there is some video freexing at times
12:09 <AdiSai1>freezing
12:11 <AdiSai1>so who want's to use twitch.tv?
12:12 <JBUni>which directory has mediaserverd?
12:14 <SwissHttp>now move to slides 21/22
12:15 <SwissHttp>"have to create" is wrong, will get removed
12:15 <snakeninny>JBUni: /usr/sbin/mediaserverd
12:15 <JBUni>ty
12:17 <JBUni>anyone dumped kernel cache from iphone 5?
12:18 <JBUni>if so, how?
12:20 <fr3b>yeh
12:21 <tihmstar>you can jailbreak your iphone 4 by using http://tihmstar.blogspot.de/2013/10/my-jailbreaktool-for-ios-7.html
12:21 <tihmstar>my tool
12:22 <tihmstar>it runs on OSX and you need to have everything installed to build opensn0w
12:22 <saelo>tihmstar any way to do this on linux?
12:22 <saelo>just need to build the ramdisk
12:22 <tihmstar>saelo: if you really want i can try to port it to linux
12:23 <saelo>let's chat later, I can probably do it, thanks!
12:23 <saelo>just need to understand how its working :p
12:23 <tihmstar>saelo: ok skype :D
12:23 <saelo>sure, after class?
12:23 <tihmstar>k
12:23 <saelo>deutsch, right?
12:23 <tihmstar>klar
12:23 <saelo>:)
12:24 <tihmstar>i guessd you're german :P
12:24 <saelo>yeah german english :/
12:25 <tihmstar>to everyone who develops tools, pls contact me and i'll put them to my repo so we have all tools collected in one place ;)
