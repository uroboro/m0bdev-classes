[08:29:20] <sidewinder96> hahaha probably the most important slide ;P
[08:29:32] <tihmstar> ^
[08:29:34] <tihmstar> focus
[08:29:50] <iosdowngrader> the class will be here right?
[08:29:56] <SwissHttp> Hi Jonathan
[08:31:50] <crakun> hello?
[08:31:53] <DarkMalloc> iosdowngrader: it is starting…
[08:31:53] <crakun> ok
[08:32:24] <hackus> just woke up

[08:37:23] <pwned4ever> k did that
[08:37:43] <tihmstar> crakun you should use mumble next time, it hink it's alot better for that
[08:37:52] <ele146cc> crakun
[08:37:53] <iosdowngrader> or teamspeak
[08:37:58] <ele146cc> can yuo add me on skype? thanks
[08:38:00] <tihmstar> nah, mumble is fine
[08:39:19] <SwissHttp> So the class is running on Skype or what?
[08:39:48] <JustVanBlooM> can smwone write it down here? i don't join Skype for this
[08:40:01] <crakun> adding more people
[08:40:06] <crakun> on Skype
[08:40:09] <iosdowngrader> downloading Skype on my macbook takes so long.. dam it :D
[08:40:16] <besartzeka> crakun ?
[08:40:23] <besartzeka> What about me on skype ?
[08:40:35] <crakun> adding people on Skype…..
[08:40:57] <iosdowngrader> crakun ive addet you
[08:41:03] <iosdowngrader> im mdrunaway on skype
[08:41:17] <sidewinder96> is it ok if im using skype on my mobile?
[08:41:23] <besartzeka> Im besart.zeka on skype
[08:41:33] <crakun> ok
[08:41:40] <crakun> I think I got everyone
[08:41:54] <sidewinder96> not me :/
[08:42:04] <isa56k> ahh man I got to go out with family... enjoy class... will catch up on slides!
[08:42:56] <tihmstar> mumble
[08:43:26] <tihmstar> guys install mumble for next time
[08:43:59] <iosdowngrader> crakun so you accepted me on Skype and now how do i get into the class?
[08:43:59] <iosdowngrader> crakun how do i get into class not (you acceptet me on skype)
[08:44:10] <hackus> this is the class
[08:44:22] <iosdowngrader> ok thanks crakun
[08:45:35] <crakun> going thru slide deck
[08:46:10] <JustVanBlooM> say tme they should mute.. bad voice so for..
[08:47:06] <crakun> slide 7
[08:47:10] <crakun> submittals
[08:47:23] <crakun> so far have been all sorts
[08:47:45] <crakun> from mobilesafari to some mov files
[08:47:52] <crakun> privilegs escalation
[08:48:02] <crakun> kernel panics
[08:48:48] <crakun> realized that we need a formal process for submittals
[08:49:22] <pwned4ever> ive fuzzed a mov file and fuzzed a txt file
[08:49:36] <SwissHttp> fuzzed a txt file?
[08:49:42] <pwned4ever> cant get a mov file to crash safari however
[08:49:50] <sidewinder96> crakun, sent you a request in skype :/
[08:49:53] <pwned4ever> yes fuzzed a txt text file
[08:49:56] <SwissHttp> me too
[08:49:58] <JustVanBlooM> how to fuzz a txt file ?
[08:50:08] <tihmstar> does that need to be a working mov file to be modified with fuzzer?
[08:50:13] <crakun> ok
[08:50:19] <crakun> for fuzzing automation
[08:50:29] <crakun> I need to see where we are at on that
[08:50:42] <crakun> there were some ideas on that last week
[08:50:58] <crakun> Cykey came up with a script
[08:51:01] <compilingEntropy> I've got it set up, my 3gs can do about 300 .mov files per hour
[08:51:01] <crakun> anyone else?
[08:51:22] <uroboro> Nexuist seemed to have one
[08:51:28] <uroboro> ketelek too
[08:51:32] <pwned4ever> nexiust
[08:51:34] <compilingEntropy> https://ghostbin.com/paste/3hjau
[08:51:37] <uroboro> *hetelek
[08:51:40] <compilingEntropy> ^ my bash script
[08:51:56] <crakun> so nexuist has something
[08:51:56] <compilingEntropy> http://nexuist.tumblr.com/ << Nexuist's work
[08:52:02] <crakun> ok great!
[08:52:30] <crakun> slide 8
[08:53:17] <Nick> whats going on all
[08:53:50] <sjas> will there be mumble next time? if not, is it just the infrastructure that is lacking?
[08:55:31] <crakun> so I'm getting .mov files  that work on different phones and firmware, but not all
[08:55:59] <crakun> yes
[08:56:05] <crakun> skype is a bit noisy
[08:56:12] <hackus> indeed
[08:56:13] <crakun> just turn down volume
[08:56:43] <crakun> so Oct 26, we will start to review some class submitted .mov files
[08:56:46] <pwned4ever> k so on to step 8
[08:56:53] <crakun> so we can learn and see if exploitable
[08:57:02] <tihmstar> i will setup mumble for next time
[08:57:09] <crakun> so get me some mov files that crash!!!!
[08:57:12] <sidewinder96> crakun, can u add me on skype? i already sent u a request
[08:57:12] <crakun> please
[08:57:33] <Nick> crakun, why not fuzz each .mov file then add them together?
[08:58:13] <SwissHttp> nick, what if the merged file crashes? Which change caused it?
[08:58:16] <argp> using the files that already cause crashes as seeds for further fuzzing is a good idea
[08:58:27] <Nick> ^
[08:58:37] <crakun> ok
[08:58:45] <crakun> slide 9
[08:59:02] <crakun> please submit .mov files and finding in this format
[08:59:08] <crakun> email in a zip
[08:59:27] <crakun> we need to move forward in class, and that depends on  your active participation
[09:00:04] <Nick> I would participate but you jerks only learn when I'm at work :P
[09:00:07] <crakun> any questions on submittals?
[09:01:48] <crakun> the sweet gem is a .mov file that will cause a kernel panic
[09:02:10] <crakun> the person who gets that, get a gold star by their name
[09:02:11] <LeoTh3o> Is there anyone available/currently logged that can access openjailbreak.org as an admin?
[09:02:25] <crakun> other bugs slide 10
[09:03:28] <uroboro> how is the kernel panic noted in the crash log? it just says so?
[09:03:56] <crakun> kernel panics cause the phone to reboot
[09:04:20] <uroboro> ah, haha, great
[09:05:26] <crakun> ok
[09:05:31] <crakun> so for slide 11
[09:05:37] <crakun> what are your answers
[09:05:42] <crakun> please type in chat
[09:05:53] <tihmstar> .mov
[09:06:04] <pr0crast1nate> Bueller.....
[09:06:09] <crakun> Bueller?
[09:06:16] <crakun> where is he
[09:06:30] <tylr> It's his day off
[09:06:35] <crakun> heh
[09:06:46] <crakun> ok, someone said pdf
[09:06:54] <crakun> anybody else?
[09:07:03] <crakun> .gif or image?
[09:07:08] <compilingEntropy> .tiff
[09:07:10] <compilingEntropy> way back in the day
[09:07:13] <tihmstar> yes
[09:07:14] <crakun> come'on folks
[09:07:16] <tihmstar> tiff
[09:07:26] <compilingEntropy> .xls
[09:07:30] <crakun> ok
[09:07:35] <tihmstar> .pdf  -.-
[09:07:42] <compilingEntropy> sms has been used
[09:07:49] <pr0crast1nate> could iPhoto be crashed with RAW image?
[09:08:05] <crakun> possibly
[09:08:25] <tihmstar> imessage this unicode bug
[09:08:30] <crakun> yes
[09:08:51] <tihmstar> webkit ?
[09:08:55] <crakun> how do we know what file type extensions are handled in the iphone
[09:10:08] <crakun> ok
[09:10:49] <pr0crast1nate> email
[09:10:55] <crakun> excellant
[09:11:22] <tihmstar> push notifications
[09:11:29] <crakun> keep thinking on this
[09:11:43] <pwned4ever> how about the new airdrop feature in io7 that uses bluetooth or wifi
[09:11:43] <pr0crast1nate> that would be cool, but I bet they're highly sanitized before display
[09:11:52] <crakun> I know we are focused on .mov files, but this is food for thought
[09:11:53] <uroboro> https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/DOCUMENTATION/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/CreatingContentforSafarioniPhone/CreatingContentforSafarioniPhone.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006482-SW15 has the limits of resources to be used in safari
[09:12:13] <crakun> kool, thank u
[09:12:25] <crakun> slide 12
[09:12:47] <tihmstar> theiphonewiki.com
[09:13:23] <SwissHttp> All references should be in the wiki. Let me know if something is missing.
[09:13:37] <pwned4ever> whats the email for you crakun?
[09:13:38] <crakun> so research URLs and irc channels, email them to me at   crakun@m0bdev.com  so that I can put them in the class slide deck for reference for everyone
[09:13:47] <pwned4ever> lol
[09:13:56] <pwned4ever> got it
[09:14:22] <crakun> stressing need for .mov files from you
[09:15:01] <crakun> so, lets move into fuzzing
[09:15:04] <crakun> part II
[09:15:27] <crakun> this is a snipit of Mobile Hacking II class I used to teach
[09:15:38] <crakun> we will speed thru this section
[09:17:10] <pwned4ever> im using zzuf on my ipad is there a fuzzer for windows youd recommend
[09:18:29] <tihmstar> what slide ?
[09:18:32] <crakun> please look at smart phone typical attack surface
[09:18:50] <tylr> pwned4ever: Windows fuzzer: http://peachfuzzer.com
[09:19:01] <crakun> unfortunately I did not have a slide number on it
[09:19:10] <pwned4ever> thnx is it free
[09:19:14] <tihmstar> slide 20
[09:19:21] <crakun> cool
[09:19:22] <pwned4ever> peachfuzzer? freeware?
[09:19:31] <crakun> yes, peach is free
[09:19:49] <tihmstar> slide 21
[09:19:52] <crakun> look at the delivery channels
[09:20:00] <crakun> following slide
[09:20:36] <SwissHttp> card reader on the iPhone?
[09:21:10] <pr0crast1nate> active would be packet injection like deauth packets
[09:22:03] <pr0crast1nate> passive would be like using Reaver and active would be like a replay attack to crack WEP
[09:22:21] <compilingEntropy> no, reaver is definitely active
[09:22:38] <pr0crast1nate> yeah bad example lol
[09:22:42] <tihmstar> slide 22
[09:24:11] <AdiSai1> what did I Miss?
[09:24:14] <AdiSai1> I had to do HW
[09:25:08] <sidewinder96> you cant even fix it by restoring?
[09:25:09] <crakun> be careful
[09:25:19] <crakun> though unlikely
[09:25:26] <crakun> fuzzing can brick a phone
[09:25:33] <SwissHttp> probably applies mainly to Android
[09:25:35] <ele146cc> isn't an wifi packet injection more easly to control and make an exploit?
[09:25:48] <compilingEntropy> in terms of fuzzing mov files, I'm guessing that's extraordinarily unlikely?
[09:25:55] <iOS5user> real brick or a restorable one
[09:26:17] <crakun> where firmware installed by manufacuter is partially overwritten
[09:27:06] <crakun> this is different firmware than what you see on IPSW
[09:27:24] <crakun> bluetooth is an example of fuzzing
[09:27:42] <crakun> i've seen it brick phones
[09:27:49] <crakun> even sms
[09:27:55] <ele146cc> crakun
[09:27:59] <SwissHttp> phones or iPhones?
[09:28:17] <crakun> there are sms attacks that can screw up your sim card
[09:28:23] <ele146cc> what if we send a wifi packet that just can crash wifi iphone's service?
[09:28:31] <jbusr> is the class still on ?
[09:28:44] <iOS5user> yes
[09:28:46] <crakun> this is a example
[09:29:44] <AdiSai1> ok
[09:29:46] <compilingEntropy> iOS Hacker's Handbook has some sms examples
[09:29:51] <AdiSai1> ya
[09:30:13] <SwissHttp> What page?
[09:30:18] <iOS5user> can i have a link to this, if its downloadable from Amazon
[09:30:26] <AdiSai1> It's paid
[09:30:30] <AdiSai1> google it
[09:30:31] <compilingEntropy> SwissHttp: I think it was somewhere near chapter 3
[09:30:33] <iOS5user> ok
[09:30:41] <crakun> it deals with messing up the SIM card via an OTA -over-the-air update
[09:30:43] <crakun> malformed
[09:30:57] <SwissHttp> page 162ff
[09:31:44] <crakun> look at bluetooth fuzzing
[09:31:54] <besartzeka> Ios Hackers Handbook's link: www.it-docs.net/ddata/781.pdf
[09:32:09] <crakun> at the protocol stack, L2CAP can be attacked
[09:32:34] <crakun> on any bluetooth device listening
[09:32:43] <crakun> you do not have to be paired
[09:32:51] <crakun> in order for this to work
[09:33:05] <AdiSai1> besartzeka thanks
[09:33:10] <besartzeka> ;)
[09:33:31] <crakun> so those are some examples of other venues of attack,  SMS and bluetooth can be dangerous
[09:33:56] <crakun> but let's focus on .mov files
[09:33:58] <crakun> for class
[09:34:07] <pwned4ever> k
[09:34:10] <crakun> ok
[09:34:33] <crakun> so let's move to slide 29 as a refresher
[09:34:50] <jbusr> is there a Wiki for this project ?
[09:34:56] <crakun> types of bugs, vulns, exploits we are looking for
[09:35:03] <crakun> we need a wiki
[09:35:15] <crakun> need a volunteer to help out on that
[09:35:39] <iMast777> jbusr: http://theiphonewiki.com/wiki/OpenJailbreak
[09:35:47] <pwned4ever> volunteer for ?
[09:35:57] <jbusr> installing mediawiki is pretty dead simple (but need where to put it)
[09:36:04] <crakun> any volunteers that can help, whether bugs or research or code/ let me know -> crakun@m0bdev.com
[09:36:13] <crakun> ok
[09:36:32] <crakun> whoops, slide 30 typo
[09:36:44] <crakun> meeting next week, sat.
[09:37:08] <crakun> ok now open floor, questions
[09:37:23] <AdiSai1> Crakun can I edit httpI//theiphonewikik.com/wiki/OpenJailbrealk
[09:37:25] <jbusr> does the new 64bit kernel has more protection then the previous 32bit one ?
[09:37:57] <iMast777> AdiSai1: Not sure why you'd want to do that, you would have to contact SwissHttp for that.
[09:38:20] <jbusr> how different is the new 64 bit arch then the 32 bit previous one in terms of all the tools that were used to the old instruction set ?
[09:38:21] <iOS5user> Should i update my iPhone to 6.1.2 (i have working SHSH blobs) or stay on 5.1.1?
[09:38:58] <crakun> on skype and irc
[09:39:08] <crakun> use complex .mov files
[09:39:45] <sidewinder96> will the 64-bit processor be killing some exploits?
[09:40:21] <crakun> with quicktime, final cut pro
[09:40:40] <iosdowngrader> @ios5user which iphone
[09:40:47] <iOS5user> 4
[09:41:09] <iosdowngrader> jeah you should can this
[09:41:40] <iosdowngrader> ios 6 is better than 5 because of the featueres
[09:41:42] <iOS5user> ok, i will probably do it later today
[09:41:43] <iosdowngrader> but 5 is ok too
[09:42:00] <iOS5user> i could always downgrade
[09:42:12] <crakun> or free software
[09:42:14] <iosdowngrader> ok than you can decide :D
[09:42:18] <crakun> that make mov files
[09:42:25] <iOS5user> lol
[09:42:38] <jbusr> ffmpeg can do .mov files
[09:43:05] <jbusr> any ideas what can be done with battery life and iOS 7 on iPhone 4S ? it's like 75% or worse then with iOS 6 when I do stuff
[09:43:20] <argp> sidewinder96, arm64 kills some exploits as surely as opens new ones
[09:43:50] <sidewinder96> you can use avid its a free video editing program
[09:44:15] <sidewinder96> argp, thanks
[09:44:38] <jbusr> the nice thing with ffmpeg is that it's open source, so you can really see how the .mov is built and try to fuzzy even more
[09:45:41] <iOS5user> is class over? im without the powerpoint
[09:45:44] <argp> a good approach is to have seed files (in this case mov files) from as many and diverse sources as possible
[09:45:50] <JustVanBlooM> ok ppl .. aim out. @crakun i'll post steps to crash to your email. as requested :) gn8t
[09:46:06] <jbusr> you can easily do a auto fuzzy with some javascirpt and html magic
[09:46:10] <crakun> and cykey is qorking on an automated fuzzing
[09:46:15] <crakun> as well
[09:46:19] <argp> create them with many different generators (ffmpeg, etc), collect them online, and so on
[09:46:28] <jbusr> i.e. keep producing MOV with FFMPEG, then host them on an HTTP server which plays a created .MOV file, and skips to the next
[09:46:33] <jbusr> when the client crashes, it will stop doing requests
[09:47:42] <tihmstar> i will try to create a mumble server for next week's class
