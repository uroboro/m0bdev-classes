10:02 <tihmstar> compilingEntropy: when was the last time i saw you here??
10:02 <tihmstar> compilingEntropy: need to talk to you after class
10:02 <+compilingEntropy> hey tihmstar
10:03 <tihmstar> compilingEntropy: also you should start using irccloud
10:03 <+compilingEntropy> yeah, that's what they tell me
10:03 <tihmstar> btw crakun you gave a look at irccloud? i invited you
10:03 <+isa56k> irccloud bnc?
10:06 <megacier> The class didn't start yet on Skype right?
10:06 <tihmstar> not yet
10:08 <@crakun> http://www.hotwan.com/class/mov/sample/1.zip is being uploaded
10:08 <megacier> ok
10:09 <@crakun> ping me if you want to join the skype
10:09 <+isa56k> yes plz
10:12 <j1m0nz> isa56k: Please show what you got on 7.0.2
10:12 <+isa56k> Dude.. I ahve nothing..
10:14 <AdiSai1> what happened?
10:15 <@crakun> has everyone downloaded today's slide deck and zip file?
10:15 <@crakun> everyone on skype that wants to be on skype?
10:15 <GrygrFlzr> Should we be on both?
10:16 <AdiSai1> yep... I'm not on skype
10:21 <@crakun> hi
10:22 <@crakun> we are on slide 2
10:22 <@crakun> need to get everyone on the same page
10:23 <@crakun> in terms of security, what is known, etc on iOS devices today
10:23 <@crakun> from 6.x to 7.x
10:23 <AdiSai1> ok
10:23 <@crakun> and that will take some time
10:31 <+isa56k> On to slide 14
10:32 <+isa56k> Looking at kernel panic bugs
10:32 <+isa56k> Every one has different phones so bug submissions coming in on different platforms
10:33 <+isa56k> Onto slide 16
10:33 <+isa56k> RE = Reverse Engineering
10:33 <+isa56k> List of tools, not everyone has IDA pro
10:33 <+isa56k> it;s expensive
10:34 <+isa56k> Will need to use GDB and IDA
10:34 <+isa56k> Hopper is an alternative for debugging / disassembler
10:34 <tihmstar> does it need to be a special version of IDA pro??
10:34 <+isa56k> dirkg ha pointed out a list of great resources, take a look at his site
10:35 <+isa56k> http://samdmarshall.com/re.html
10:35 <tihmstar> slide 17
10:36 <+dirkg> Something of note
10:36 <+isa56k> Book: A Bug Hunters Diary
10:37 <+isa56k> http://www.amazon.com/Bug-Hunters-Diary-Software-Security/dp/1593273851
10:37 <+dirkg> if people have questions about anything on there, ping me on twitter, here, email and i can try my best to answer.
10:38 <+isa56k> mediaserverd has issues with trying to parse so many different types of files
10:38 <+isa56k> This can generate buffer overflows that can be exploited
10:38 <+isa56k> Need to really understand the format of a .mov file and how it works
10:39 <+isa56k> What makes the mov file crash, where does it crash and why?
10:39 <+isa56k> 1. Understadn quicktime format mov files.
10:39 <+isa56k> 2. Disassemble mediaserverd in IDA pro
10:40 <+isa56k> 3. Look at  where the inputs from media server go into the kernel
10:42 <+isa56k> Slide 21:
10:45 <+isa56k> Anyone found any tools for auditing mov files?
10:46 <tihmstar> uroboro has tools to view the hexdifference of 2 files and to create "backmodifed" files, both will be available on my cydia/apt repo repo.tihmstar.org soon (i hope)
10:46 <Nexuist_> hi guys
10:48 <tihmstar> i will try to collect the tools developed for openjailbreak and put them on my cydia repo
10:48 <megacier> I need the links a last time :S
10:49 <+isa56k> https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/quicktime/QTFF/qtff.pdf
10:49 <+isa56k> Quicktime specifications from Apple
10:51 <tihmstar> log: we need to understand what i0nic is doing
10:51 <+Nexuist> Hi guys
10:51 <tihmstar> we need to be up to date with his work
10:52 <+Nexuist> He hasn't publicized anything yet
10:52 <tihmstar> you should have a look at i0nics presentations
10:53 <+Nexuist> I mean, in regards to giving sploits to Apple
10:53 <+fractalg> dont talk about what you dont know ;)
10:53 <+compilingEntropy> tihmstar is logging the class on irc from what crakun is saying.
10:53 <tihmstar> ^
10:53 <+Nexuist> ah ok
10:54 <+Nexuist> thanks tihmstar
10:54 <+compilingEntropy> i0n1c has done a lot of good work for the community in terms of presentations
10:54 <+compilingEntropy> crakun is saying we should capitalize on what information he's made available
10:54 <+Nexuist> I agree
10:56 <@crakun> <crakun>	 i need you to review all of Stefan Esser's work chronologically -VERY IMPORTANT
10:56 <@crakun> we will need this to get the team synched up on the latest and greatest / history/ memory management, etc
10:56 <@crakun> read slide decks and see videos on the net
10:57 <@crakun> we really need to be synched in this
10:57 <@crakun> 	 also mark dowd's work
10:57 <@crakun> also charlie miller
10:57 <@crakun> OSX Reverser
10:58 <@crakun> and whatever eda3rs work
10:58 <+fractalg> i have no public work in ios :X
11:01 <+dirkg> oh fractalg did you get kext signing rights yet?
11:02 <tihmstar> we need the kernelcache
11:02 <tihmstar> there's propably a tool we can use for that
11:02 <+Nexuist> xpwntool
11:02 <tihmstar> we have to dump kernelcache on runtime from device
11:03 <+fractalg> i didnt ask yet
11:03 <tihmstar> there are people doing that for winocm's jailbreak
11:03 <+fractalg> but we will need them
11:03 <tihmstar> we should ask him for some kind of binary or script
11:03 <+dirkg> yeah i asked and I still don't have them
11:03 <+dirkg> don't know what is taking so long
11:04 <+fractalg> should have no problems since it's legit software
11:04 <+fractalg> might ask them personally what's up with that process
11:05 <tihmstar> you should review the slidedecks for next week
11:05 <tihmstar> review i0nic slidedecks
11:05 <tihmstar> i0nic = Stefan Esser
11:06 <tihmstar> also Charlie Miller
11:08 <tihmstar> we need information leaks for the kernel
11:08 <tihmstar> so that we can perform ROP
11:08 <@crakun> ok
11:09 <@crakun> my skype is crashing i thinkl
11:09 <JuanEnrique> hey crakun
11:10 <@crakun> ok, so info leaks is one of the things I want to see if we can get thru .mov or thru posixspawn
11:10 <@crakun> skype is crashing on me
11:10 <@crakun> let me resume class in 5 minutes
11:11 <@crakun> take a 5 minute break while I reboot
11:11 <megacier> ok
11:11  → O0l joined  ⇐ xf8a and crakun quit  
11:15 <O0l> What's the problem with the Skype?
11:15 <tihmstar> crakun's skype crashed
11:17 <+fractalg> it's the nsa :X
11:17 <O0l> What is NSA?
11:18 — +compilingEntropy facepalm
11:18 <a_titkov> ...
11:18 — +Nexuist throws out printer and jumps through window
11:18 <tihmstar> spam mails are a real problem for NSA storage server XDDD
11:18 <+isa56k> NS.. whoo? :D
11:21 <tihmstar> http://imgur.com/HY0GVKh
11:21 <tihmstar> XD
11:21 <uroboro> Apple's letter 'a' class is NSA
11:22 <tihmstar> [10/26/13 7:18:17 AM] crakun -: information leaks is something we want to take a look at
11:22 <tihmstar> [10/26/13 7:18:50 AM] crakun -: there are plenty avenues still how to get this
11:22 <tihmstar> [10/26/13 7:19:46 AM] crakun -: I don't have irc client showing up so please type what I say into there for me please
11:22 <tihmstar> [10/26/13 7:20:08 AM] crakun -: need more examples of interpreting crash reports if you can find them
11:22 <tihmstar> [10/26/13 7:20:28 AM] crakun -: even though we are only focused on kernel panics at this time
11:22 <tihmstar> information leaks allow us to bypass KASLR/ASLR
11:23 <tihmstar> it will become clearer as we develop more
11:23 <tihmstar> slide 62
11:23 <Intram0rph> hey guys  am i too late for class..?
11:23 <Intram0rph> sorry.. i see
11:24 <tihmstar> homework slide 62-64
11:25 <crakun> ok
11:25 <crakun> open floor
11:25 <crakun> we do have 2 people speaking afterme
11:25 <crakun> as well
11:25 <crakun> but let's see if we can get your questions either on Skype or IRC
11:25 <crakun> now
11:26 <+dirkg> if you would like
11:26 <+dirkg> i could write up something on reading crash reports
11:26 <+dirkg> it would be based on stuff from landon and apple's docs on them but if you need some more stuff on them
11:27 <JuanEnrique> crakun could you please provide me some references to learn objective c, c, and arm assembly?
11:27 <+dirkg> JuanEnrique http://samdmarshall.com/re.html
11:27 <+dirkg> under language resources
11:29 <tihmstar> how can i see what type of kernelpanic i got? can i see it from the crashlog?
11:32 <tihmstar> fuzzycactus is available at repo.tihmstar.org :D
11:34 <crakun> now we are introducing compilingEntropy
11:34 <crakun> for his SIGSEGV and SIGBUS having problem with commands
11:37 <+isa56k> Entropy: What you using to create the mov files and then play with them beofre fuzzing?
11:37 <+compilingEntropy> sony vegas pro 12
11:37 <crakun> demito, are u here?
11:37 <+isa56k> ok thx
11:38 <crakun> ok, demito
11:39 <crakun> will try perhaps next week to catch up with him
11:39 <crakun> next week, we have a reverse engineer coming in to teach us more
11:44 <crakun> we will go deeper next week in researching isa56k sample mov files, panic logs
11:45 <crakun> crank up gdb, IDApro, inspect inside .mov file, we need to get ahold of kernel cache as well
11:46 <crakun> mediaserverd is a big focus and it's hooks into the kernel
11:47 <megacier> I'm a freaking noob and I would like to be better at programming/hacking. How should I do?
11:47 <sulphur27> i can't get kernel panic on iPhone 3gs 6.1.2 in safari
11:47 <megacier> neither on ipod 4
11:48 <crakun> is that isa56k's bug?
11:48 <sulphur27> yep
11:48 <sulphur27> i load file via http in safari, i will try local
11:49 <+isa56k> sulphur27: I used lighttpd abd then sbopenurl to launch the mov
11:49 <sulphur27> ok i will try that
11:49 <+isa56k> got to go.. back on later tonight
11:50 <sulphur27> thanks
11:50 <+compilingEntropy> sulphur27: add repo.tihmstar.org to cydia
11:50 <crakun> please spread the word for class, all eyes on hotwan.com/class/mov/sample/1.zip
11:51 <tihmstar> crakun: how can i work with that file if it's not crashing my device?
11:51 <+compilingEntropy> fuzz the original to see if you can panic your device with that, right?
11:52 <crakun> steps to take (slide 61 -63) on http://hotwan.com/class/MHVI-Day6h_Published.pdf
11:54 <crakun> tihmstar, note your device / firmware -let me know via email so I can track. The use original 1.zip file and fuzz with it to see if you can make it crash on your device
11:54 <crakun> original mov file in 1.zip
